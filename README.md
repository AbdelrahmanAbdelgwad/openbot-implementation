## Person-Follower Robot

**Tools & Technologies:** Arduino, Python, Autonomous Navigation

Implemented a person-follower robot based on the Intel OpenBot framework, achieving a 90% success rate in following a person in various indoor environments. Collected over 5000 data points of navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor environments, which were used to train a navigation policy achieving an 85% accuracy rate in obstacle avoidance.
